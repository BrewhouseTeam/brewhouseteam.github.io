              Pat found his love for design back in the age of table-based designs and spacer GIFs. Getting his professional start at a small print and web design studio in London, Ontario, Pat's ambition quickly led him to start his own freelancing business working with startups and international brands.

An avid musician and former professional chef, Paulo pours his heart and soul into everything he does. In fact, we were so impressed by Paulo's efforts during the <a href="http://brewhouse.io/2015/08/05/the-apprentice.html">3-month apprenticeship program</a> that we decided to hire him as a full-time employee just two months in.

              A film industry veteran, Alex has done everything from guarding parking lots to mastering Hollywood blockbusters. The increasing need for workflow automation sparked his love of software development and since then he has nurtured a growing passion for writing clean and beautiful code. In 2015, he decided to further hone his skills by enrolling in <a href="https://codecore.ca/">CodeCore's web developer bootcamp</a>, where he excelled at the top of his class. He drinks tea, not coffee, and craft beer, not domestic.
