          <p>Loft 47 processes transactions for real estate agents and brokers so they don’t have to. They contacted us in the spring of 2015 to design and develop an MVP they could take to brokers to validate their ideas for improving the conveyancing process.</p>

<p>Our process started by interviewing people in the real estate industry — agents, brokers, conveyancers, and administrative assistants — to better understand their motivations. This research led to several key insights that were fundamental to the way we designed the application, the most important being the prioritization of the agent/client relationship.</p>

<h2 id="lighting-up-the-darkness">Lighting Up The Darkness</h2>

<p>From the moment an agent signs with a new client to the time a deal is made, the agent’s primary role is to be in constant communication with their client. Sometimes this is to pass along important information, other times it’s to assuage any fears the client develops along the way. Generally, agents are in contact with their client at least once a week leading up to the closing of a deal.</p>

<p>However, once a deal has been reached and the conveyancing process begins, clients tend to find themselves inside of a black box where information regarding their deal is no longer accessible. The conveyancing process involves multiple parties, from brokers to conveyancers to lawyers and more, all of whom have tasks that need to be completed before a deal can be completed. In today’s system, the client has no insight into who is responsible for ensuring their deal is being taken care of.</p>

<p>Loft 47 solves this problem by making the conveyancing process transparent to everyone involved. Each party is invited to a page which tracks the status of everyone’s tasks bringing everyone into alignment. People are held accountable, deals are processed faster, and clients feel secure knowing their deal is in good hands.</p>

<h2 id="constant-iteration">Constant Iteration</h2>

<p>Our team worked alongside Loft 47 every day, meeting each morning to discuss what work had been completed the day before and what was to be done that day. This transparency allowed us to collaborate with Loft 47 on key decisions as soon as they came up, rather than waiting for an arbitrary deadline before key decisions were able to be made.</p>

<p>This process allowed us to quickly iterate on ideas and get crucial feedback from the client throughout the entire project. We were able to identify and test our assumptions on a daily basis, saving the client precious time and money and allowing our team to move forward confident we were all on the same page.</p>

<h2 id="ship-quickly-learn-often">Ship Quickly, Learn Often</h2>

<p>As this project spanned several months, it was important that we not allow too much time to pass between the time we had something to test and the time we received critical feedback. With each iteration, Loft 47 was able to take the work we completed and share it with their customers. This feedback played a crucial role in refining our understanding of the problem and the solution we eventually shipped.</p>

<h2 id="beyond-shipping">Beyond Shipping</h2>

<p>Our work with Loft 47 wasn’t finished when we shipped the initial MVP. Along with deploying the application, we also aided Loft 47 with recruiting and hiring the team who would take the product to the next level. Our knowledge of the developer community here in Vancouver allowed us to quickly identify the right people for the job and help ease the transition from working with us to working as an in-house team.</p>

<h2 id="the-proof-is-in-the-pudding">The Proof is in the Pudding</h2>

<p>Here’s what Sasha Hryciuk, founder of Loft 47, had to say about working with Brewhouse:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I loved working with Brewhouse’s team on the development of our MVP. Their talent depth provided access to resources I could trust for product management, design and development. They were great at communicating process and clarifying technical complexities, making the handoff to my internal team simple. Brewhouse delivered an incredible product and set Loft 47 up for success.</p>
