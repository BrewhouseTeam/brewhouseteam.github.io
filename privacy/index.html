      <p>If you have questions about deleting or correcting your personal data please <a href="&#109;&#097;&#105;&#108;&#116;&#111;:&#104;&#101;&#108;&#108;&#111;&#064;&#098;&#114;&#101;&#119;&#104;&#111;&#117;&#115;&#101;&#046;&#105;&#111;">contact us</a>.</p>

      <p>Brewhouse Software Inc. (“Brewhouse”) operates several websites including <a href="http://brewhouse.io">brewhouse.io</a>, <a href="https://goodbits.io">goodbits.io</a> and <a href="http://watchthefile.com">watchthefile.com</a>. It is Brewhouse’s policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our websites.</p>

      <h2 id="website-visitors">Website Visitors</h2>

      <p>Like most website operators, Brewhouse collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Brewhouse’s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Brewhouse’s visitors use its website. From time to time, Brewhouse may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.</p>

      <h2 id="gathering-of-personally-identifying-information">Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</h2>

      <p>Certain visitors to Brewhouse’s websites choose to interact with Brewhouse in ways that require Brewhouse to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that Brewhouse gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up to publish newsletters at Goodbits.io to provide a username and email address. Brewhouse collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with Brewhouse. Brewhouse does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.</p>

      <h2 id="protection-of-certain-personally-identifying-information">Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information</h2>

      <p>Brewhouse discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on Brewhouse’s behalf or to provide services available at Brewhouse’s websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using Brewhouse’s websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. <strong>Brewhouse will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone</strong>. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, Brewhouse discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when Brewhouse believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Brewhouse, third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered user of a Brewhouse website and have supplied your email address, Brewhouse may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what’s going on with Brewhouse and our products. We primarily use our various product blogs to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. Brewhouse takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.</p>

      <h2 id="cookies">Cookies</h2>

      <p>A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor’s computer, and that the visitor’s browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. Brewhouse uses cookies to help Brewhouse identify and track visitors, their usage of Brewhouse website, and their website access preferences. Brewhouse visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using Brewhouse’s websites, with the drawback that certain features of Brewhouse’s websites may not function properly without the aid of cookies.</p>

      <h2 id="business-transfers">Business Transfers</h2>

      <p>If Brewhouse, or substantially all of its assets, were acquired, or in the unlikely event that Brewhouse goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of Brewhouse may continue to use your personal information as set forth in this policy.</p>

      <h2 id="privacy-policy-changes">Privacy Policy Changes</h2>

      <p>Although most changes are likely to be minor, Brewhouse may change its Privacy Policy from time to time, and in Brewhouse’s sole discretion. Brewhouse encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to its Privacy Policy. If you have a Goodbits.io account, you should also check dashboard for alerts to these changes. Your continued use of this site after any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such change.</p>
