<p>ZOMG! I’m in Japan!</p>

<p>This year, I am fortunate enough to be one of the 750 attendees at Ruby Kaigi in
Tokyo. If you are among one of them, I’d love to meet you and chat about Ruby,
Rails, etc. Just look for my name tag!</p>

<p><img class="img-responsive img-right" alt="My name tag" src="/images/posts/ruby-kaigi-2014/name-tag.jpg" /></p>

<p>For those of you who couldn’t make it this year, don’t feel left out! I’ll be
writing a three-part blog post (one for each day) to cover the things I’ve
learned here, so you can watch the talks online that interestes you when they
become available. (You can also watch the <a href="http://rubykaigi.org/2014">live streams</a>!)</p>

<p>Without further ado, here is day 1 at Ruby Kaigi!</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/nagachika">@nogachika</a>, who is known for his <a href="http://d.hatena.ne.jp/nagachika/searchdiary?word=%2A%5Bchanges%5D">ruby-trunk-changes</a>
commentary (it’s like <a href="http://rails-weekly.goodbits.io">Rails weekly</a> but for
Ruby trunk), gave a behind-the-scene view of CRuby development.</p>

<p>There are 84 registered accounts on SVN (including a bot), 50 of which who had
at least one commit since Ruby Kaigi 2013. @nogachika introduced some of them in
his talk, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://twitter.com/yukihiro_matz">@matz</a> who invented Ruby (and
<a href="https://github.com/mruby/mruby">mruby</a>), whose only commit of the year was to
<a href="https://github.com/ruby/ruby/commit/ae9bda718da8181d47f379a243e384f892448c50">bump the Ruby version</a>
(Matz focuses more on the design aspect of Ruby as well as mruby development
these days).</li>
  <li><a href="https://twitter.com/koichisasada">@ko1</a> who introduced incremental GC in Ruby 2.2</li>
  <li><a href="https://twitter.com/nari3">@nari</a> who introduced Symbol GC, which played a key role in Rails’ plan to target 2.2+ exclusively in Rails 5</li>
  <li><a href="https://twitter.com/tmm1">@tmm1</a> who introduced many performance optimizations, including speeding up <code>Hash#[]</code></li>

  </a>
</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/koichisasada">@ko1</a> works on Matz’s Ruby team at Heroku.
Over the years, he has accumulated an impressive list of contributions to the
Ruby language/implementation, including native thread locking, fibers, the new
method cache, flonum, RGenGC and incremental GC in Ruby 2.2 (more about it in
vol 0048 of the <a href="http://magazine.rubyist.net/">Rubyist Magazine</a> and his talk
at the upcoming <a href="http://rubyconf.org/">RubyConf 2014</a>).</p>

<h3 id="tradeoffs">Tradeoffs</h3>

<p>The overarching theme of his talk is about making tradeoffs. Like many things in
life, most decisions we make as programmers are tradeoffs that affects multiple
intertwined goals that are often in conflict with each other. As engineers, it
is our job to understand about these tradeoffs, carefully consider the factors
in-play and overcome these challenges.</p>

<h3 id="parallel-execution">Parallel Execution</h3>

<p>One of the specific example @ko1 talked about is the problem of supporting
parallel execution in Ruby.</p>

<p>Simply providing parallel threads (i.e. getting rid of the GVL) to enable
parallel execution is actually a relatively easy task. The difficulties here is
to maintain good programming experience, good serial execution performance (due
to increased synchronization) and CRuby source code quality/maintainability.</p>

<p>Running multiple threads in parallel under the typical “share everything”
programming model often results in subtle bugs that falls under the following
categories: race conditions, atomicity violation and order violation. Making
matters worse, the non-deterministic nature of parallel execution make these bugs
very difficult to reproduce. All of these problems contribute negatively to the
“programmer happiness”, which is a very important cornerstone of the Ruby
language.</p>

<p>
  <a href="/images/posts/ruby-kaigi-2014/thread-wizards.jpg">
    <img class="img-responsive" alt="Wizards use threads" src="/images/posts/ruby-kaigi-2014/thread-wizards.jpg" />
  </a>
</p>

<p>@ko1 believes that the tradeoff here is not unlike other problems we faced in
the past, such as the safety/performance tradeoff of garbage collection vs
manual memory management. In this case, parallel threads is like manual memory
management – while it’s highly performant and flexible, it’s also extremely
error-prone and very difficult to reason about. He believes that Ruby’s job is
to provide an alternative programming model for parallel execution that is safe
and programmer-friendly, as well as good debugging tools. Ultimately these will
be preferred over utilizing threads directly for most applications, just like
how garbage collection is now preferred by many programmers.</p>

<p>He then briefly introduced a few ideas for implementing such models in Ruby and
some academic research on making parallel execution deterministic.</p>

<h3 id="gc-benchmarking-community-and-more">GC, Benchmarking, Community and more!</h3>

<p>In the rest of his talk, @ko1 did a similar analysis on other topics such as
Ruby garbage collection, making measurements and becoming a CRuby committer. If
those topics interests you, be sure to check out this talk!</p>

<h2 id="symbol-gc">Symbol GC</h2>

<p>
  <a href="/images/posts/ruby-kaigi-2014/symbols.jpg">
    <img class="img-responsive" alt="@nari talking about symbol GC" src="/images/posts/ruby-kaigi-2014/symbols.jpg" />
  </a>
</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/nari3">@nari</a> is a CRuby committer from NaCl. He gave an
overview of the “Symbol GC” feature he implemented for Ruby 2.2.</p>

<p>As I mentioned earlier, this is one of the key drivers for the Rails team to
target Ruby 2.2 in Rails 5. A common misconception about this feature is to
think that all symbols will be GC-ed so we don’t have to worry about it anymore.
As @nari shows us in this talk, it turns out this is not entirely correct.</p>

<p>To understand this, we first have to understand the problems associated with
using symbols in CRuby 2.1 and below. Currently, once a symbol is allocated,
they are associated with a fixed numeric ID internally, and are never garbage
collected. This includes symbol literals (<code>:a_literal</code> in Ruby code), dynamic
symbols created in Ruby land (e.g. <code>"a string".to_sym</code>) and other side-effects
(e.g. defining a method “foo” allocates a symbol <code>:foo</code> for use in the methods
table).</p>

<p>The pitfall associated with this approach is that over the execution time of
your program, you could accumulate many symbols that you no longer need, thus
leaking memory. This is particularly problematic for programs that have a long
lifetime and handles a lot of user inputs, as it has the potential to be
exploited by malicious users and cause DOS attacks.</p>

<p>Web applications written in Ruby (e.g. Rails applications) happens to fit this
description perfectly. For example, the following piece of pseudo-code is bad:</p>

<p><code>
value = store.fetch(params[:key].to_sym)
</code></p>

<p>As you can see, a user supplied string is being converted into a symbol (a
dynamic symbol allocation). This is problematic, because an attack could send
a bunch of different strings under this parameter and eventually cause the
server to crash when it runs out of memory. In fact, this has been a common
source of security issue in Rails (e.g. CVE-2012-3424), which explains the
desire to require Ruby 2.2 in Rails 5.</p>

<p>Currently, symbols cannot be GC’ed because they need to maintain the same ID
for the C code that depends on it (for example, if the corresponding symbol has
been GC’ed as the C code looks it up via <code>ID2SYM</code>, then things would break).</p>

<p>To solve this problem, symbols are now classified into two categories – immortal
symbols and mortal symbols. As the name implies, immortal symbols are not
garbage collected by the runtime and have a stable ID, so baiscally how symbols
work today. Mortal symbols, on the other hand, can be garbage collected by the
runtime just like any other objects. They don’t have an ID, so they are usually
only useful in Ruby-land.</p>

<p>As it becomes necessary, mortal symbols will be “pinned-down” by the runtime and
becomes immortal symbols. Because they are marked as “uncollectable”, their
memory address becomes their IDs and hence they can be used in C code. For
example, consider this piece of code:</p>

<p><code>
define_method(method_name.to_sym) { ... }
</code></p>

<p>Here, the runtime first allocates a mortal symbol (from <code>method_name.to_sym</code>)
that can be garbage collected. As it is passed into <code>define_method</code>, however,
the runtime would convert it into a immortal symbol so that it could be used in
the methods table. Once this happens, the symbol can no longer be garbage
collected – it is impossible to convert an immortal symbol back into a mortal
symbol. Also, if an immortal symbol with the same name has previously been
allocated from a different place, the same symbol will be reused here instead.</p>

<p>While this approach eliminates a entire class of potential bugs, it also
introduces some new pitfalls. In particular, if a dynamic symbol (mortal by
default) is converted into an immortal symbol, your program will suffer from the
same vulnerability as before.</p>

<p>Therefore, as application programmers, we still need to be mindful of when a
dynamic symbol might be converted into an immortal symbol. While you probably
aren’t defining dynamic methods based on user inputs (if you are, you might
have bigger problems to worry about!), it is possible that passing a dynamic
symbol into a C function might cause it to become immortalized (e.g. when the C
code calls <code>SYM2ID</code> on it). While most of the CRuby C code has been refactored
to avoid this landmine, it is still a common problem in third-party extensions.
@nari noted that our ecosystem is still undergoing a transition period, and
things would get better overtime (Rails 5 is probably going to help accelerate
that as well).</p>

<p>I highly recommend that you watch this talk, especially if you maintain a gem
and/or C-extension.</p>

<h2 id="transactional-memory-and-ruby">Transactional Memory and Ruby</h2>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/ReiOdaira">@ReiOdaira</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/brucehsu">@brucehsu</a>
did two different talks on how transactional memory can benefit the Ruby
language.</p>

<p>Transactional memory is similar to how a database transaction works. It allows
the programmer to place a block of code inside a memory transaction, during
which all memory operations will be perceived as a single atomic operation from
other threads (or fails and the operations are rolledback and aren’t observable
from outside of the thread that requested the transaction).</p>

<p>@ReiOdaira’s talk focuses on his research at IBM that utilize hardware-based
transactional memory to reduce Ruby’s dependency on the global VM lock (GVL)
thus improving the degree of achievable parallization.</p>

<p>@brucehsu’s talk focuses on software-based transactional memory techniques, and
showed the world how it could be done by writing a new Ruby VM in Go, aptly
called <a href="https://github.com/brucehsu/GobiesVM">Gobies</a>.</p>

<p>If you are interested in how these cutting edge technologies can be used in
Ruby, these talks are for you!</p>

<h2 id="wrapping-up">Wrapping Up</h2>

<p>That about wraps up my notes for Day 1 of Ruby Kaigi 2014. Of course, there are
many other talks that are equally interesting. However, it’s already 3AM here in
Japan and I should probably get some rest ;) I encourage you to check out the
<a href="http://rubykaigi.org/2014/schedule">conference schedule</a> for a full list of
talks.</p>

<p>Stay tuned for part 2 &amp; 3!</p>
