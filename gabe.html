        <br/> Weâ€™re ashamed &mdash; poor Gabe. He had to share a welcome blog post with Lana and weâ€™re reminded monthly of such a slight on our parts. So, for the record, we want all to know that we are so #blessedup to have Gabe on the team and have decided to dedicate our homepage to all things Gabe.

       <strong>Philippe:</strong> &mdash; Gabe enabled Brewhouse to press the Turbo button: a 33 mhz productivity increase fueled with Veggie Breakfast Sandwich with Bacon, colourful shirts with ninja fruits and fast development with gabascript. Brewhouse would not be Bro'house without him.</a>

       <strong>Kalv:</strong> &mdash; Without Gabe I would not be using <strike>Snapcat</strike> Snapchat today, yep he introduced me to DJ Khaled on there.</a>

       <strong>Pat:</strong> &mdash; If it wasn't for Gabe, I would have continued believing that I was good at Tetris.

       <strong>Paulo:</strong> &mdash; Gabe told me that I am his favourite chef turned developer. But I am the only chef turned developer that he knows.

       <strong>Alex:</strong> &mdash; Before I met Gabe, I thought Javascript was just for alert dialogs. Now, I code only in Stage-0 ES9, and Iâ€™m loving every minute of it!

       <strong>Edward:</strong> &mdash; In the short time that Iâ€™ve worked with Gabe, Iâ€™ve learned a ton. Like the optimal spice/sauce ratio to place on chicken wings, or the ability to judge, visually, whether a wing can be de-boned and consumed in one motion, like a cat consumes a fish in cartoons.

       <strong>Lana:</strong> &mdash; Gabe is cool AF. <â€” I learned that from him. Itâ€™s like I met that foreign friend who only teaches you the dirty words of their language. Thatâ€™s Gabe to me.
