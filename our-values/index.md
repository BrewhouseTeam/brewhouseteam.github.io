title: Our Values
---

Powered by distinction & collaboration.

Here are the values our team practice internally and with clients daily. There are always more but
these are the ones we focus on the most.

- Always Collaborate
- Ask why (Be Distinctive)
- Test Everything
- Be Transparent
- Be Passionate
- Give Back
- Be Kind

# Always Collaborate
- Work with everyone on everything, contribute to marketing, sales, code discussions.
- Ask for feedback and peer review, others can help make things way more awesome.
- Instead of criticizing, empathize. Why did someone do such a thing, understand, listen and discuss.
- Even when you know something is ready, always check with the team to see if there is feedback. An example of this is to always open up a Github Pull Request for code changes that affect a product.

# Ask why (Be Distinctive)

- Everything we do has been done before, how can we push to be better and open minded to think of something distinctive?
- To do this figure out Why we are doing something to create a better solution.
- When we run a social media campaign how can we push the bar of something fresh, creative and interesting.
- Solve people’s problems in ways that haven’t been done before, let’s believe that the impossible is possible.

# Test Everything

- Taking the developer’s practice of test driven development we should apply that to other areas of our business.
- Thinking about everything in tests encourages us to think about how we measure the success or quality of the work we do.
- Run experiments where results can be determined in days/weeks (never years!).
- We’ll never be right or perfect, so how do measure what is working and not.

# Be Transparent

- Being transparent avoids confusion on focus and team politics.
- Opening up about we do builds trust internally and externally.
- Go as far as sharing salaries, revenue, hiring, strategy and learning.
- Being honest and sharing what we are doing, in turn makes us further humble and open to learning from others. We will never know everything.
- Take coffee meetings with the community to share learnings in tech, product & business (CEO down). Our [podcast](/show/) is an example of this.

# Be passionate

- Love what you do, otherwise don’t do it.
- You only do your best work when you care and love.
- Doing what you want makes you happy. Happy workers create great work.

# Giving Back

- Our business and many other exist based on work created by people for free. We should do as much Open source work as possible to continue the efforts.
- Encouraging others to do the same through Community involvement.
- Meet with as many people in the community for a Coffee, share learnings and encourage others to build great products.
- Improving well being of society, specifically the area at which our office is located.

# Be kind

- Born from MINASWAN - Matz is nice so we are nice in the Ruby community.
- To collaborate with one another we must as a group be kind and give to one another.
- Never hold grudges, there’s not need to stay negative towards people.
- Everyone is unique and have their reasons for being, there is no need to mock or pick on people.
