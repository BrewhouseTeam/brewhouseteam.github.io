Zozi hired Brewhouse to augment their team for the purpose of accelerating their projects and improving their application by reducing complexity and increasing site performance.

## On Process

We work with clients that follow our thinking around how to design and develop great products. This means that we integrate with the current team's processes rather than work one way for us and another with the team.

We attended all of Zozi's planning and standup meetings throughout our engagement. We provided feedback on those processes to further optimize how best to work as a team and deliver high quality software. Their team had a workflow around developing the code and testing it in staging, and we followed these practices rather than disrupt their team.

Conversation is very important to our values and a habit we encourage through every stage of our development process. As Zozi is based between Vancouver and San Francisco, conversation was encouraged to take place through digital tooling so context was never lost. We used [HipChat](https://www.hipchat.com) for chat, [Pivotal Tracker](http://pivotaltracker.com) for planning, and [Github](http://github.com) for code reviews and discussion.

## Improving the Performance of Zozi.com

One of the areas of work we performed with Zozi was to improve the performance of their application as they were preparing to send out a large amount of email campaigns. These campaigns in turn would bring users to the site and place orders with their e-commerce offering.

We started by measuring and analyzing as much data as we could and reviewed their [NewRelic](http://newrelic.com/) data to determine areas of focus to investigate further to improve the application throughput. This involved some of our Senior Ruby developers to dig deep into Zozi's code and database to find areas to optimize. We published [Fixing a slow Rails development Server](/blog/2015/04/27/fixing-a-slow-rails-development-server.html) to  our [blog](/blog/) to provide more information on this kind of work.
