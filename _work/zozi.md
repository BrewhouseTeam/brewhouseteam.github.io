## Show banner ads to all those that click.

Retarget Links came to us with an idea: create a shortlink which, when followed, would allow advertisers to neatly retarget ads later based on the link the user had clicked. By inserting a retargeting pixel in the URL shortener's interstitial page, Retarget Links allows advertisers to display 10 banner ads which reinforces their message to their audience.

The idea for Retarget Links was brought to us on a napkin. After measuring the scale required for initial launch using [tool], we built an app with Rails, built in payments with Stripe, and shipped just 6 weeks later allowing TractionConf and others to start using the app.
