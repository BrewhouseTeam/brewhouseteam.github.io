title: How we work
---

Through our strong values we constantly evolve our methodologies to help ship great
working products.

With whatever we do, whether that is a [product design sprint], [development] or [design] work for existing [products or MVPs] we follow these areas of principles.


## Coding
Without code we won’t have software. So we work to be the best at the code. Yep that means Ruby, Javascript, CSS, HTML, our tooling, our wood saw, hammer.

Coding doesn’t have to be just programming. This could be codifying a design in a wireframe using Sketch. Coding can help communicate a complex problem between designers and developers.

## Testing
We test everything.

Unit tests / Integration testing
User feedback / Invision discussion

## Listening
How can we determine the answers if we don’t know the right problem we’re trying to solve.
We encourage the details to be spoken and are interested to hear them. This means we know the questions to keep asking to get closer to the business domain knowledge we need.

## Designing
No, we’re not talking about pixels, colours and stuff.
Thinking. Reviewing all ideas. Understanding.

Our [Product Design Sprint] consists some of this in the conventional way but we

This doesn’t just mean visual UX or UI concepts. But designing architecture and code. Whenever something is too complex, we stop as there must be a simpler to do something.

## Values
(XP has "communication, simplicity, feedback, and courage”)
We perform daily habits that relate to [our values] (Explain further about why it’s relevant to the work we do briefly and link further).

## Great Communication
We require a great constant communication channel between the teams we work with.

We do that with tooling like Slack, Email & Google Docs. Every week kicks off with an iteration planning session, we do daily stand-ups to uncover any blockers.

Having an open friendly communication channel encourages feedback. And importantly ensures that decisions are made with the team rather a developer or designer. The product owner always needs to make that decision - which is you the client.

## Simplicity
We still use Rails today as a our framework because it’s simple, works and maintainable, this is changing as we look at Elixir/Phoenix for WebSocket handling but we’ll only use a certain technology if it’s the simplest tech.

The same applies to design, simple is best. We question “Why” on adding a new page, button or product feature.

KISS - Keep it simple stupid
YAGNI - You aren’t going to need it https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You_aren%27t_gonna_need_it
DRY - Don’t Repeat Yourself. Follow conventions and methods used by computer science theory built over the last 70 years.

# Constant Feedback
Our value of Collaboration encourages this to occur as frequently as possible with the customer, team and application.

- Feedback from the application:
     - Unit tests / acceptance tests to catch regression
     - Monitoring and alerting services in production

- Feedback from the customer
     - By deploying constantly (Hourly to Daily), each feature can be tested when it’s completed.
     - The sooner feedback can be obtained, context is learned.

- Feedback from the team
     - When requirements are discussed, we do this openly with the developers, designers and client.
     - The team provides feedback on implemented code by reviewing Github Pull Requests

# Respect
- We respect that everyone has something to contribute irrelevant of their experience.
- Providing respect to those that know the business domain so that they we can [listen], [design] and [code] to the best of our ability.

# Embracing change
- Provide flexibility to change based on feedback
- By testing our code it allows things to change and give the developers confidence to know that important areas of the product remain working to the highest possible quality
- Knowing that everything can be better and never perfect
- Small decisions vs larger decisions

(Yes to those of you that know our field these are based off the XP Principles kindly put together by Kent Beck)

# Our Services

## Product Design Sprint
- Based off Google Ventures and Thoughtbot
- In 5 days we can help refine what you’re looking to build or extend on your product
Here’s a little overview of how that works...

## Shipping MVP or Product

### Development
Ruby / Javascript / React.js
Every software product, needs developers. We are continually pushing ourselves to be better beyond just the code. Our [methodologies] guide us.

### Design
Ask why


## Staff Augmentation
Let us help deliver your features while you grow your team or take on larger complex rebuilds..
Kick start your company by having us be your development team...
