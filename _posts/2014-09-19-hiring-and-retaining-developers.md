Lots of people tend to ask me to help them hiring developers; what should they pay, what should be in the job spec, how do I find them, who do I know to hire?

Most of the time this doesn't matter. What does matter is what goes on your current company. The current quality of code, product management, team and practises. The culture is what matters to hiring and keeping great developers.

With the many teams and companies I've worked with I've seen developers be attracted to the quality of code created by teams. Sometimes people want to join just because one individual spoke at a conference or wrote interesting blog practises sharing great practises within their business. Even seen developers leave disgruntled because the product management process sucked or dealing with a messy codebase.

Developers care about what they ship. So what can be offered to allow them ship, higher quality software.

Let me explain some areas that I believe are important to hiring and retaining good developers.

## Code quality

If I'm a cook, would I want to cook food in a messy, un-organized kitchen? Um, nope.

You must be able to show that your code is clean or even getting better. There are methods to do this (another longer post maybe, comment if you're interested). Gone are the days where legacy codebases stay legacy, if it's messy it's because you haven't shown it's a priority as a business.

### Tests

The first area would be your test coverage. Is it high, do you take time to improve it, can you show stats on this from your continous integration server.

Continous Integration like CircleCI runs your tests on every new code commit added. This encourages the team to not break the code and fix it when it does break.

### Collaboration / Learning

Do you encourage collaboration, peer review, pair development where possible.

Learning new things, go to conferences, read content to learn new methods, what new things above what i'm writing in this article can you try to be seen as leaders in the industry.

### Code stats / conventions

There are lots of tooling out there to measure your code complexity. They measure how well you use known conventions, well structured code...

.. More to come ..

There are services like Code Climate which run reports regularly on your code and scoring it. Great way to get alerts when the score becomes worse. They can reward specific developers 

## Project practises

Do you work in a flexible agile way?
  - Good granular stories, clear roadmap, good direction and guidance.
  - Milestones
  - Themes
  - Disturbing developers from the business, Scrum master

## Tooling / cutting edge?

- Tooling, are you using the best things because they are the best thing for the job, Slack for conversation, Pivotal for story development, Developers using Macs are good example of this, if you're working with web developers that expect OS X environments, you've probably bought them. So what else is there to be used that they expecting. CircleCI (as mentioned earlier)

Some people take this as far as, we have a table tennis table, keg, la di dah. I'm not getting at these items but rather tools of the trade.
