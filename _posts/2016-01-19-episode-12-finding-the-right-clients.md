[We got one!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4SUl69RFJ8) One of our wonderful listeners, Kelly, wrote in this week to provide feedback for our show and one of the key insights we took away from her email was the desire to hear more about running an agency. Though Brewhouse is only 2 years old, there is more than a decade of combined client services experience and wisdom to be shared by both Kalv and Pat. This week, our dynamic due tackle one of the toughest questions facing client services agencies: how do you find the right clients?

<!-- break -->

What characteristics do we look for in a client? How does a client's reaction to our pricing affect our decision to move forward with a project? How can product agencies earn and maintain trust with a client? We discuss all this and more on this week's episode of [The Brewhouse Show][TBS]!
