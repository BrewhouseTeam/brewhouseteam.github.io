Continuing from [part 1](/blog/2014/09/18/ruby-kaigi-2014-day-1) and [part 2](/blog/2014/09/19/ruby-kaigi-2014-day-2),
of my Ruby Kaigi blog posts, here is the final day at Ruby Kaigi!


Talks will be available soon™
-----------------------------

Good news everyone! It looks like the wait is almost over – the official Ruby
Kaigi account has [tweeted](https://twitter.com/rubykaigi/status/513917550128660481)
that the talks will be made available on YouTube soon™. Follow them to get
notified when that happens!

Brief notes on the day 3 talks
------------------------------

To be honest, I didn't go to as many talks on the third day, not because they
weren't great (those I attended was excellent), but because I was spending time
hanging out with the #rubyfriends I made at the conference. With that said, here
are some highlights of my last conference day:

* **Speeding up Rails 4.2**

  The [@tenderlover](https://twitter.com/tenderlove) session, in Japanese! Here
  Aaron showed off his adequate Japanese skillz by delivering a full talk in
  fluent Japanese; he even made a few puns in Japanese! For those who couldn't
  wait for the talk to become available (or those who don't speak Japanese), you
  can catch watch [a similar talk](http://www.confreaks.com/videos/4142-cascadiaruby2014-speed-up-rails-speed-up-your-code)
  Aaron gave at [Cascadia Ruby](http://cascadiaruby.com/) today.

* **The Ruby Challenge**

  In this session, [@sikachu](https://twitter.com/sikachu) hosted an interactive
  Ruby game show. The contestants were picked from the audience randomly (we
  were given a card with a unique number when we walked in) to answer five
  questions about the performance characteristics of 10 pair of Ruby snippets
  that performs the same task.

* **Tending the Ruby ecosystem**

  [@_zzak](https://twitter.com/_zzak) shared his journey of becoming a open-
  source contributor in the Ruby ecosystem, why it is important to give back
  to the community and some pointers on how you can start contributing.

* **Ruby 2.1 in Production**

  In this closing keynote, the legendary [@tmm1](https://twitter.com/tmm1) shed
  some light on Github's experience on rolling out Ruby 2.1 in production, how
  it improved the performance on their site, as well as his history with Ruby,
  the story of him becoming a Ruby committer and more.

As always, there are many more great talks at the conference, so be sure to
check out the full [conference schedule](http://rubykaigi.org/2014/schedule).

See you next year?
------------------

Overall, Ruby Kaigi has been a great conference for me. Here, you will find some
in-depth technical talks that you won't find in other conferences.

In addition to being an excellent platform for facilitating the exchange of
technical knowledge, it is also an incredible platform for cultural exchange. It
was a breath of fresh air for me to attend a conference outside of my "bubble"
in North America. It was a such a great learning experience for me to see some
of the Japanese Rubyist (and other Rubyist coming from around the world) are
using the language to solve problems in a ways that I am not used to (or to
solve problems that I didn't even think of before).

It also reminded of why I loved being part of the Ruby community. Ruby Kaigi is
the conference where the creator of the language hands you your lunch box, where
the core committers are holding signs and greeting you as you walk into the
conference venue every morning, where English and Japanese-speking Rubyist would
spend years learning and delivering their talks in each other's language.

I am very greatful to be part of this amazing conference this year. I am looking
forward to being there again in the future – and I hope see you there too!
