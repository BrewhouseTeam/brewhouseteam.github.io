If you walk along the many of the beaches surrounding the city of Vancouver, you might find someone slowly and methodically scanning the stones along the shore. She is looking for a stone that catches her eye, not because it is all that different from the rest but because it has a certain quality that uniquely identifies it from others around it. Maybe it's perfectly smooth and beautifully rounded, or perhaps it is shiny and shimmery with sharp edges. For certain, there is a unique quality that draws her specifically to it.

Here at Brewhouse, we've begun an evaluation of the values of our company. This year has brought the team both wonderful opportunities and a few bumps along the way. As we begin to look toward 2016 we are asking ourselves what type of company we want to be, what goals we want to accomplish, what types of projects we want to be a part of, and how we can improve how we work with one another. In short, what qualities will Brewhouse embody over the coming years to come?

We want to be a company who is uniquely different, whose values permeate every aspect of our business, and who chooses the pursuit of quality over quantity.

So, what exactly is quality?
