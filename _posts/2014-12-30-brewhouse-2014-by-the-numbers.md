we became *Boohouse* for Halloween and we collected non-perishable goods for the
food bank at the *Mouthy Mixer*.

<!-- break -->

We had the chance to work with [12 great
clients](/#clients).
We've built MLPs (Minimal *Lovable* Products). We've improved
codebases (read, [performance](/blog/2014/11/10/healthy-codebase-and-preparatory-refactoring.html)). We've delivered
complete libraries and products.
Being exposed to so many talented teams was just fabulous!

we write [blog posts](/blog),
we work on side projects such as [Roundup
Roger](http://brewhouse.io/2014/06/27/say-hello-to-roundup-roger.html),

We offer 4 day iterations to our clients. That's 4 full days (Monday to
Thursday) dedicated to client work. Friday can be used as a
buffer to cover statutory holidays or sick days.

We plan product work like client work. 4 days / iteration. And we keep
it simple.

We loved sharing space at [ChloiHQ](http://chloi.io), however more resources means more space. In
August we found a comfy office space to call our own.
