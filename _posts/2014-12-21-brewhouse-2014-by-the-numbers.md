# **4** parties

We started with *Cocktails*, we then hosted the *[Vanruby](http://vanruby.org) Summer BBQ*,
we renamed our office to *Boohouse* for Halloween and collected non-perishable goods for the
food bank at the *Mouthy Mixer*.

brewer is starting right after XMas!

# **12** clients

<!-- break -->

We had the chance to work with [12 great
clients](/#clients).
We've built MLP (Minimal *Lovable* Product), we've improved
their codebase (hence [their
speed](/blog/2014/11/10/healthy-codebase-and-preparatory-refactoring.html)), we've delivered
complete libraries and products.
Being exposed to so many talented teams was just fabulous!
