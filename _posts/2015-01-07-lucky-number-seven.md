We’re excited to announce that the Brewhouse Team has grown to seven!

## Meet, Mark.
![Dapper picture of Mark](/images/posts/2015/jan/mark.jpg)
He’s our new Product Manager.

[Mark](https://twitter.com/markhazlett?lang=en) is joining us from Pensio, where he worked as Chief Product Officer and Co-Founder. Originally from Alberta, he started his software career working at Apple in their technical support department. From there he decided to go to school and learn how to code. After that, he started his own gaming company and went to work for 2 top 200 sites ([Expedia](http://www.expedia.ca/) and [iStockphoto](http://www.istockphoto.com/)).

Let’s learn even more about him!

<p><em><strong>Q:</strong> What appealed to you about Brewhouse? Why did you want to work here?</em>
<br><strong>A:</strong> Company culture is king and Brewhouse has created an amazing culture.</p>

<p><em><strong>Q:</strong> What do you consider one of your greatest accomplishments?</em>
<br><strong>A:</strong> Built iPhone/iPad apps that have been downloaded and used by over a million people.</p>

<p><em><strong>Q:</strong> Looking out 3 &#8211; 5 years, beyond the obvious trends, what do you think will be the next big change in our industry? </em>
<br><strong>A:</strong> I think drones are going to be the next big trend. It’s expected to be a 1B market by 2018 and we’re going to see some applications we haven’t even thought of yet.</p>


<p><em><strong>Q:</strong> What is the most embarrassing professional screw up you’ve had? What did you learn from it?</em>
<br><strong>A:</strong> When I got my first programming job, I created a model framework for the Zend PHP framework. When I was writing the update attributes method I accidentally overwrote the entire user database and changed all 200k users first/last names to my name. Luckily it was only the development database and we were able to revert it back to a known good state. I learned how important it is to properly test your code.</p>

<p><em><strong>Q:</strong> What publications or blogs do you read?</em>
<br><strong>A:</strong> I normally read Hacker News, Designer News and Growth Hackers on a daily basis.</p>

<p><em><strong>Q:</strong> What&#8217;s your favourite </em>twitter<em> handle to follow. And why?</em>
<br><strong>A:</strong> <a href="https://twitter.com/pmarca" target="_blank">@pmarca</a> &#8211; He has fantastic advice for entrepreneurs. Reading his tweetstorm’s will make you a better entrepreneur.</p>

<p><em><strong>Q:</strong> Favourite Quote</em>
<br><strong>A:</strong> The Holstee Manifesto

</p>

<p><em><strong>Q:</strong> How would your friends describe you in one word.</em>
<br><strong>A:</strong> Ambitious</p>

<p><em><strong>Q:</strong> And since you&#8217;re a Brewhouser</em> <em>now, we need to know, how </em>you do<em> like your coffee?</em>
<br><strong>A:</strong> <a href="http://cupandbrew.com/blogs/cupandbrew-blog/9982689-pare-down-your-caffeine-and-increase-your-dairy-with-an-antoccino" target="_blank">Antoccino</a> &#8211; 1:1 ratio of steamed milk and espresso.</p>

## Mark’s Expertise

Mark will be working on web based projects and starting to work on early mobile based applications (Goodbits!). His ability to create stellar wireframing + design early in the product development process makes him an asset.
