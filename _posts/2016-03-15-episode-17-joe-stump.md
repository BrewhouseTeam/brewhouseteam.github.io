This week, Kalv and Pat are joined by technical leader and serial entrepreneur, [Joe Stump](https://twitter.com/joestump). As the founder of [Sprint.ly](http://sprint.ly), [SimpleGeo](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/simplegeo), and [Attachments.me](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/attachments-me), Joe has gained a tremendous amount of knowledge and wisdom which he graciously shared with our listeners during a live [Blab.im](https://blab.im/brewhouse-software-interview-w-joe-stump-cofounder-of-sprintly-simplegeo-and-attachments-me) chat.
