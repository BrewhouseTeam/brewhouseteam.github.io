Every company needs a purpose for existing. Here at Brewhouse, we have continually refined our purpose as we've gained a better understanding of who we are and what we want to do. Over the past month we've been having a number of discussions around our purpose, or mission, and how our values serve that mission. On the eve of leaving for a company retreat up in beautiful Whistler, BC, Kalv and Pat share some of the thinking that's been happening around who we are as a company and what our purpose is.
