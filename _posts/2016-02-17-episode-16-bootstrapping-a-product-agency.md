Some companies spend more time crafting investment and sales pitch decks in PowerPoint than designing prototypes, running user tests, and developing a shippable product. Regardless of your business model or marketing strategy, you need to produce something that people will use. Something that improves someone's life, something they will tell their friends and family and co-workers about, something that that is born of empathy, innovation, technical skill, a truck load of coffee, and time.

As a product agency, Brewhouse is able to invest the profit we generate from our [consulting service](/#services) into [Goodbits](http://goodbits.io), a simple tool for curating and sending email newsletters, and still [turn a profit](/blog/2016/01/06/brewhouse-2015-by-the-numbers.html) as a business. Find out how on [this week's episode](/2016/02/17/episode-16-bootstrapping-a-product-agency.html) of The Brewhouse Show.
