As we look to kick off the new year, we take a moment to retrospect the first season of [The Brewhouse Show][TBS] and ask ourselves what worked, what didn't work, and what we'll change in the future. We talk about a few new technologies we want to try out, share a few podcasts we enjoy, and set goals for what we hope to achieve in 2016.
