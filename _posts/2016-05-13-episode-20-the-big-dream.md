One of the easiest mistakes to make as a company is to lose sight of where you're headed. When your team has their heads down, hammering away at their keyboards, it's important to have a destination to look towards to keep everything else in perspective. This week, Kalv and Pat talk about the process Brewhouse is taking to establishing a Big Dream for the next 3â€“5 years, and what we hope that Big Dream will do for us as we work day to day crafting products people love.
