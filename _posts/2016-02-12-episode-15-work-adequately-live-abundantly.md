Every week has 168 hours. Who we are as people is a culmination of how each of us decides to spend that time. This week, Kalv and Pat discuss how we value time at Brewhouse, whether the various benefits some tech companies offer their employees are for the sake of the employee or the company, and what changes we are contemplating here at Brewhouse to further improve the work/life balance of our own team members.
