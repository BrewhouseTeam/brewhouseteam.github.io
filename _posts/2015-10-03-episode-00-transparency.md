One of our core values here at Brewhouse is &ldquo;Test Everything&rdquo;, so when Kalv and I began bandying about the idea of doing a podcast we knew we'd need to test it. And so, with as little fanfare and (hopefully) technical issues as possible, it is my pleasure to share with you Episode 00: Transparency (we couldn't possibly do a pilot episode about transparency and not share it, could we?).
