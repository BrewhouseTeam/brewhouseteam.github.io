One of our core values here at Brewhouse is &ldquo;Test Everything&rdquo;, so when Kalv and Pat began bandying about the idea of doing a podcast they knew they'd need to test it. And so, with as little fanfare and (hopefully) technical issues as possible, it is our pleasure to share with you Episode 00: Transparency (we couldn't possibly do a pilot episode about transparency and not share it, could we?).

The show should be available in iTunes in the next couple of days. In the meantime, you can [subscribe to the show](http://feedpress.me/brewhouse-show) in your podcatcher or RSS reader.
