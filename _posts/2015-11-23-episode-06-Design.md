This week, Kalv and Pat chat about design. Is design hanging pretty ornaments on a tree, or is it establishing thoughtful systems to help users with a problem? What's the difference between a Creative Director and a Design Director? How does design theory apply to design practice? And what the heck was Web 2.0?
